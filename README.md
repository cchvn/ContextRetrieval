# Context retrieval exercice

This python script evaluates an algorithm that is supposed to retrieve the context of a question.

We used the dataset SQuAD 1.1.

To run the code you will add to clone the repository :

`git clone https://github.com/cchvn/ContextRetrieval`

And then run the code with the command line : 

`python ContextRetrieval.py`

It returns the evolution of the recall in terms of how many contexts we choose to consider.
